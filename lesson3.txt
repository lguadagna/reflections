looks like there is now a button to create a new file directly on github
I like this new editor. 

Pull manually because I want control!! hahahah

fork: clone directly onto git hub and give credit to person who created the code
clone: create a copy in your local directory 
branch: make a new version of the code 

what is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? 
1. diff's are much faster
2. you can work off line. 
3. you can check the status of the commit before pushing changes



git branch different-oil
git checkout different-oil
git says => switched to branch 'different-oil'
git add cake-recipe.txt ( a different version of it ) 
git commit
git says => 1 file changed... 
*** git push origin different-oil 
git says => counting... etc

How would you collaborate without using git or github? what would be easier and what would be harder? 
I think we'd check into a source control system and then pull into a different directory and diff the files that way. So in a sense git diff is easier. I have a visual compare tool called beyond compare that does a visual compare of files in directories that is actually way easier than the text based diff from git.
