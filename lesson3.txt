looks like there is now a button to create a new file directly on github
I like this new editor. 

Pull manually because I want control!! hahahah

fork: clone directly onto git hub and give credit to person who created the code
clone: create a copy in your local directory 
branch: make a new version of the code 

what is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? 
1. diff's are much faster
2. you can work off line. 
3. you can check the status of the commit before pushing changes
